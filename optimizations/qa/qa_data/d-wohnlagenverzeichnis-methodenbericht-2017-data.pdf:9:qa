Here are 15 question-answer pairs based on the provided document page:

**1. What is the difference between the Ausgangswerte and the Statusindex?**
Antwort: The Statusindex does not provide a percentage, but is dimensionsless.

**2. How was the Statusindex calculated for addresses?**
Antwort: Each address received the status value of its statistical district, followed by averaging the values of surrounding 10 addresses to smoothen border effects.

**3. Why was the Statusindex introduced in the first place?**
Antwort: To reduce "Grenzproblematik" (border problems) and ensure that status values are representative of reality.

**4. What is the Bodenrichtwert indicator used for?**
Antwort: It assesses the average value of a plot of land per square meter on the basis of Bodenrichtwert zones, which roughly align with block sides.

**5. How are Bodenrichtwerte calculated?**
Antwort: They are calculated annually by the Gutachterausschuss (expert committee) of the Hansestadt Hamburg and then averaged over the last three years to reduce volatility.

**6. What is the purpose of averaging Bodenrichtwerte?**
Antwort: To reduce high volatilities on a small-scale level.

**7. How are Bodenrichtwerte transferred into address data?**
Antwort: Through spatial intersection using a Geoinformationssystem (GIS).

**8. Has the Bodenrichtwert been used in the past?**
Antwort: Yes, but only as part of the "Gebietsstatus" indicator on a larger scale.

**9. How is the Grünflächenanteil calculated?**
Antwort: By determining the percentage of public green spaces within an 800-meter radius around each address and calculating a mean value per block side.

**10. What sources do you use for Grünflächenanteil calculations?**
Antwort: The city's Grünplan (green space plan) and Geoinformationssystem (GIS).

**11. How is Einwohnerdichte calculated?**
Antwort: By comparing the number of inhabitants to the number of buildings with residential use at the level of statistical districts.

**12. Why is a pure look at population numbers not possible?**
Antwort: Due to different district boundaries, making it meaningless to compare population figures across districts.

**13. How does Einwohnerdichte relate to other indicators?**
Antwort: It combines two values (inhabitants and buildings) to provide a meaningful comparison.

**14. What is the main goal of calculating Einwohnerdichte?**
Antwort: To gain insights into population density at the level of statistical districts.

**15. Is there any additional information available about the Statusindex calculation?**
Antwort: Yes, more detailed information can be found in the Pilotbericht zum Sozialmonitoring 2010 of the BSW (available online).
