Everything begins with the words ‘I’m pregnant’. These words trigger
something different in each and every one of us. And that’s totally okay.
What’s important is that you never have the feeling that you’re alone as

GOOD TO KNOW: THE REGULAR GERMAN PAEDIATRIC
EXAMINATIONS AND THE ‘YELLOW BOOK’
The regular German paediatric examinations are very important and are paid for by
the statutory health insurance company. When you go to exam appointments U1
to U9 and J1, bring along the ‘yellow book’ you were given when you were released
from the clinic. Every detail about your child’s development is documented there.
This makes it possible to diagnose and treat possible delays or irregularities
promptly.
Some paediatricians and statutory health insurance companies will remind you of
your next regular German paediatric examination. And the city of Hamburg will
invite you to multiple exams to improve children’s health and
protection.

easy. You might not be able to be with your baby during its first days, or it might
be receiving treatment or even supported by machines.
Take time to get used to the situation and get to know and
